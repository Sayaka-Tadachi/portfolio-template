            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <div class="detail">
                <p>This is an on-going group project. I teamed up with two other developers. My role is to research,
                    provide a project brief, create wireframes and design the final prototype. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Our goal is to create a hair salon searching and booking system for desktop and mobile experience.
                    Our aim is to provide people a smoother and more organised experience when booking their next hair
                    appointment. Our product will be a great communication platform for both customer and service
                    provider to have follow-ups after the appointment and to preserve the service histories.</p>

                <p>I started with researching other websites and apps in the market.</p>
                <p>We were able to find two similar websites. One from Japan and one from Europe.</p>
                <p> We couldn't find any Canadian competitor.</p>

                        <p>First, I designed each box with a label, then I added pre-filled text in the box. Having both
                            a label and pre-filled text gave crowded looks. I removed labels and was much cleaner but
                            then it made me concern about accessibility. How would a screen reader user experience this?
                            What about a user with a cognitive disability? Would they be confused about what was each
                            box was for after started typing and not able to see the pre-filled text anymore?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I needed to have another indicator besides pre-filled text to increase the clarity of
                            indication for each box. My solution was to have icons. The icon can indicate what each box
                            is for in simple form with minimum space. </p>
