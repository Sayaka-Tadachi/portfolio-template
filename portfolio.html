            <h3>My first attempt at making a portfolio</h3>
            <p>I added this page because I approached building my portfolio website as I would any project. This website
                you are currently viewing is my second iteration. Below I will highlight my design decisions.</p>
            <div class="project_page">
                <div class="ver1">old </div>
                <img src="portfolio1-homepage.jpg" alt="homepage">
            </div>



            <p>This was the homepage. There was only a header and hero image. Nothing more. The image, which I continued
                to use, has every letter of my last name. The overall website interface is simple so this image will add
                color to pop. On the second iteration of the website, I added a little bit about myself and images with
                links to guide to each page under the hero image.</p>

            <div class="project_page">
                <div class="ver2">new </div>
                <img class="version" src="new home page.jpg" alt="image of new homepage">
            </div>







            <p>Here is the change I made with the mobile view. I had a different interface for the mobile view before,
                but I tried to keep the same interface of the desktop view as much as possible. I changed my mind about
                the hamburger icon for the menu because there were only three things on it. To keep it simple, I
                adjusted the position of the menu bar.</p>

            <div class="mobile">

                <div class="mobile1"><img src="portfolio1-homepage-mobile.jpg" alt="">
                    <div class="ver3 ver">old </div>
                </div>

                <div class="mobile2"><img src="new mobile work.png" alt="">
                    <div class="ver4 ver">new </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>As I was making a website, I was learning more. So it was natural that I was able to do more complicated
                coding by the time I finished the first website. <br>These are the before-and-after pictures of the
                project personas page.</p>

            <div class="project_page">
                <div class="ver1 ">old </div>

                <img src="old-project.jpg" alt="image of old website">
            </div>
            <div class="project_page">

                <img src="new-project page.jpg" alt="image of new website">
            </div>

            <p>I enjoy the process of product designing and I am hoping to do more. I am a dedicated self-starter,
                passionate about making people happy. The development of technology allows us to do so much but only if
                it's accessible. I believe that web accessibility and inclusive design is a necessity for our modern
                society. I will keep learning to design products that are equally usable to everyone and support the
                society to keep up with fast-pasted technology evolutions.</p>
