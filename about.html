                Thank you for visiting my website. I made this website as my portfolio. It includes my work as a product
                designer and photographer. Also, little bonus at the end, my favorite brownie recipe because I'm sure we
                can all appreciate good brownies.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I started building the website, my knowledge of coding was close to zero. I learned basic HTML and
                CSS online and kept learning as I was building my first website. I managed to code a website, but
                immediately I thought, I can do better. What you have on your screen right now is my second attempt. I
                have made a website before using a hosting service, but I wanted to challenge myself and built it from
                scratch. By coding the website structure myself, I have a better understanding of product development,
                which can be reflected in my design thinking.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I strive to learn more to be a better designer. My goal is to increase my knowledge and skills in
                inclusive design and in creating accessible experiences. I believe that good design is design that in
                useable by anyone.
