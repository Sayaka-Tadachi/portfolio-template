                <p>This project was to design an e-commerce website for the clothing brand "blanc blanc".</p>
                <p>blanc blanc is a newly launched brand, based in Toronto. This brand is proud to offer products that
                    are ethically-made, high-quality and affordable prices. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The client wants this website to be clean and approachable like their brand theme. Also they think
                    the website should creat a more shopping in the store feeling rather than looking through a catalog.
