            <p><span>Midnight story</span><br><br> This illustration was made in abobe illustrator. The idea was
                inspired by Youtube cooking show "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJeRHRoOuI8">ひとりごとエプロン
                    (Soliloquy Apron)</a>" created by channel 北欧、暮らしの道具店 (Scandinavian, tool store for a living). The
                woman is reading a book under the night lamp and moonlight.<br><br>This was my first complicated vector
                illustration.

                business. <br> His old logo was made online with a free resource. He found out that someone else was
                using the exact same logo and was looking for a new one.<br><br>
                He had German Shepperd years ago and he loved her so much so I wanted t include her. I also used tire
                track and wrench as an aspect of the auto repair business. </p>

                <br>I learned how to organize layers, create a shape out of multiple shapes and how to create a glowing

            <p><span>Islanders</span><br><br>This is a UI idea for a mobile version of the game Islander created by
                GrizzlyGames. This colorful island-building game is only available on the desktop. I draw this idea
                because I wished it was available on mobile. <br><br>Challenging part was to keep the roomy interface in
                the smaller mobile screen without making the island and items too small to see or touch. <br><br>Link to

            <p><span>musubu logo</span><br><br>musubu is my on-going project with two other developers. <br><br>"musubu"
                means "to connect" or "to tie a knot". <br> The logo is not final yet and these are six ideas to choose
                from. I tried to incorporate the meaning of musubu by either having a knot illustration as a part of the
                logo or modify middle "s" and "u" to connect "mu" and "bu"<br> <br>I got the inspiration for the style
                of knots from how Japanese people knot a fortune-telling paper (omikuji) to a branch of a tree in the
                shrine.</p>

            <p> <span>Mother's day e-card'</span> <br><br>2020 Mother's day, many people were not able to see their
                mother under the COVID-19 situation. <br>I thought, we may not give our mothers hugs and kisses but we
                could still show our appreciation to her by sending an e-card. <br><br>I made this using adobe
                photoshop. I chose this background color to set a bright tone and to enhance the flower color. </p>

            <p><span>Bakery grand opening poster</span> <br><br>I made this on adobe photoshop. <br>I myself is a home
                baker, follows other home bakers on Instagram. I saw one home baker was commenting that she needs a
                poster for her newly opening bakery business. I took this opportunity to make this poster to offer her
                help. <br><br>I chose Amatic SC and Wawati SC for the bakery name font. These lightweight, soft fonts
                remind warm and soft freshly baked bread. I used 2 colors that mutually enhance each other but also they
                are great background colors for the brown color of croissant image..<br><br> The name of the business
                has been changed because she ends up not using this poster. She only wanted a white and black simple
                poster without any picture. <br><br>Even though the poster wasn't used, this was a great opportunity for
                me to practice design skills, and to take the first step to reach out to people might need help.</p>

            <p><span>E-commerce shop : UI design</span> <br><br>This was a one of Daily UI challenge I did.<br>Theme was
                given by Daily UI every week. This time challenge was to design UI for single item page for E-commerce
                shop. I decided to design a page for a cosmetic brand. <br><br> First I wrote down ideas for this shop
                such as name, item, brand theme and target user. Next I picked about 12 fonts that matches brand theme
                and picked 2 fonts to use from there. <br><br>I designed logo for this brand on Adobe illustrator then,
                I rendered 3D image of item on Adobe Dimention. Finally, I designed both mobile and desktop single item
                page on Adobe XD. <br><br></p>
